Communism has never gained much of a foothold in the United States, although the Communist Party USA, founded in 1919, has run candidates for public office over the years.10 As a result of the post-World War II Red Scare in the U.S., Congress passed legislation outlawing the Communist Party in 1954. But much of that law has since been repealed, and the party remains in existence.11

 

Socialism has fared better but has also had its ups and downs. Numerous socialists have been elected to positions as mayors and several have been elected members of Congress.12 Eugene V. Debs, who was the socialist candidate for president in five elections (1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920), earned close to 1 million votes on his final try.13 More recently, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, was a serious contender for the Democratic Partyâ€™s presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020.

For decades, the terms communist and socialist have been used in the U.S. to attack political opponents who are often neither. Similarly, countless government programs and legislative proposals have been denounced as socialist or communist by those who oppose them for one reason or another. Both of those traditions continue to this day.
